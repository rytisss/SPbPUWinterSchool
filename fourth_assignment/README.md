#HOMEWORK- 1 

 You are hired by NASA as a Data Scientist, Congratulations!
 Your first project;  you have to classify stars based on their astornomical measurements,  0 non-pulsar, 1-pulsar
 Luckily astronouts gave  you a dataset after making observations through our Galaxy
 Your job is to use ML techniques as SVM, Decision_tree, Random_forest and Kneighbours
 Which ML model gives the best?
 Because you are working in NASA, they have very clean dataset(there is no preprocessing!)
 To learn more about pulsars
 You will find your dataset inside the rar file named as "pulsar_stars.csv"
